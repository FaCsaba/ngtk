# Neographers' Toolkit

Neographers' Toolkit is my Computer Science final year project at the University of Debrecen.

## Setup

**Requirements**:
- Zig (v0.13)
- Node (v21+)

To run the frontend application make sure to compile the agent.
You can do so via this command 
```bash
zig build
```

Copy the resulting wasm from from `zig-out/bin` to `frontend/src/assets`.

Run the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

![A diagram showing the architecture of ngtk. At the bottom is a box titled "Agent" with the description: "Platform agnostically renders the specified font, acts as an input method editor". From that an arrow points to a box with a dashed outline titled "Agent Interface". From that two arrows, one pointing to the box titled "Web App" with the description: "Creates glyphs, specifies keyboard layout, and previews with an embedded agent", the other one points to the box titled "Desktop App", with description: "Thin layer over the cross-platform implementation of the agent".](docs/imgs/ngtk_architecture.png "Architecture")

- Web App
    - A web application written in typescript for users to be able to create their own glyphs in an svg editor.
    - Users can assign a keyboard key to a glyph or assign words to a glyph.
    - Users can also preview their creation in an online version of the desktop application.
- Desktop App
    - A platform specific implementation driving the agent through it's interface.
- Agent
    - Platform agnostically renders the specified font, acts as an input method editor.
